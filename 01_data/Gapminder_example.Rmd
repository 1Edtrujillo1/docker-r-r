## Gapminder Example

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gapminder, subset = year == 2007, log = "x")

if (require("dplyr")) {
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp))

# how many unique countries does the data contain, by continent?
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n(), n_countries = n_distinct(country))

# by continent, which country experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in
# life expectancy and what was the drop?
gapminder %>%
